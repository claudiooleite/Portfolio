      <Text>
        I began my coding journey seven months ago, diving into the Odin
        Project's Foundations course. This rigorous program gave me a solid
        grounding in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript through hands-on projects and an
        incredibly supportive community.

        To further hone my skills, I pursued the{" "}
        <Badge colorScheme="blue">
          Meta Front-End Professional Certification
        </Badge>
        . This comprehensive course advanced my knowledge, covering modern
        frameworks and advanced topics. I became proficient in React, state
        management, and responsive design. One highlight was building the Little
        Lemon Restaurant Web App, a project that tested and showcased my skills
        comprehensively. You can explore this and other projects on my profile.
