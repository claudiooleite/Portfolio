          I'm ClÃ¡udio Leite, a front-end developer who loves creating dynamic
          and user-friendly web applications. I started my coding journey seven
          months ago with the Odin Project's Foundations course. This hands-on
          program taught me the basics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, supported
          by a great community.

          To improve my skills even further, I completed the{" "}
          <Badge colorScheme="blue">
            Meta Front-End Professional Certification
          </Badge>
          . This course helped me learn modern frameworks and advanced topics. I
          became proficient in React, state management, and responsive design.
          One of my favourite projects was building the Little Lemon Restaurant
          Web App, which tested and showcased my abilities. You can see this and
          other projects on my profile.
